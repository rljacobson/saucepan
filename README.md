# saucepan

Data structures and utilities for dealing with source spans.

### Requirements

 * Integration with error reporting (`codespan_reporting` or equivalent)
 * lightweight span
 * span can be input type (i.e. gives access to slice)
 * span can also give `(row, col)` info
 * unambiguous multi-file support

Would also be nice to have generic input type, but just `&str` is ok.

### Existing libraries

1. [`nom_locate`](https://crates.io/crates/`nom_locate`)
    1. Excellent integration with `nom`.
    2. generic input type
    3. minimal location types
    4. Includes `Source`/`Sources` types
    5. _No support for reporting_
    6. _lots of unsafe_ (a requirement of its design decisions)
2. [`codespan`](https://crates.io/crates/codespan)
    1. Native integration with `codespan_reporting`
    2. lightweight
    3. _no buffer/slice, thus cannot be used as input_
    4. Otherwise full-featured.
3. [`source-span`](https://crates.io/crates/source-span)
    1. Very nice, full-featured. Includes:...
    2. error reporting
    3. Text buffer
    4. Location types
    5. _allocating_
4. [`rls-span`](https://crates.io/crates/rls-span)
    1. Excellent for its purpose
    2. _Way_ more abstractions than necessary (`ZeroIndexed`, `OneIndexed` subtraits of `Indexed`)
    3. _Poorly documented_
    4. _No slice/buffer â€” location only_
    5. _No error reporting_




## Is saucepan right for you?

### saucepan's use case

Saucepan's use case is a situation in which a single type needs to serve as both an input slice type
compatible with `nom` and a span type (potentially compatible with `codespan_reporting` or
equivalent).

### when to use something else

If you only need `nom_locate` or codespan, or if your application can just as easily use both
`nom_locate` and `codespan` to satisfy its needs you probably shouldn't use this crate.


This crate should not be used in production at this time. Potential contributors should look at the
TODO.md file and the `// todo` comments if they want guidance on what to improve.

## ...why?

The purpose of this crate is to have a single *thing* that can take the place of both
 `nom_locate::LocatedSpan`
 and `codespan::Span`. That thing is called Span in this crate. A span can

 * be used as an input/output type for `nom` parser combinators
 * be queried for the byte offset, line (row) number, and column number of the text it represents
 * provide a `&str` of the text it represents
 * keep track of the file handle of the original source file the text is from
 * support a mechanism to retrieve the name of the source file
 * be lightweight, implement `Copy`
 * intgrate with `codespan_reporting` or equivalent

The `Span` struct itself implements copy.
